# Terraform\_CI/CD\_Pipeline\_Project - README

---

## 🌟 Project Title

**Terraform-Based CI/CD Pipeline Automation**

---

## 🔍 Project Purpose and Vision

In modern DevOps practices, automation is the key to building scalable, reliable, and fast deployment systems.

This project demonstrates how you can use **Terraform** to **automatically generate CI/CD pipeline configuration files (YAML)** dynamically, modularly, and environment-specific (dev/stage/prod).

It is built to simulate how a real-world DevOps Engineer would manage dynamic pipelines across different environments.

---

## 🏐 Why This Project?

- To master real-world Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.
- To show advanced Terraform concepts in action: Modules, Workspaces, Dynamic Blocks, Lifecycle management, etc.
- To have a **solid, practical, resume-ready project** for DevOps Engineer or Cloud Engineer roles.
- To demonstrate strong understanding of CI/CD Automation and Terraform synergy.

## 📆 Roadmap to Build This Project

| Step | Description                                                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Create project skeleton and module structure                        |
| 2    | Define variables (jobs, stages, filenames)                          |
| 3    | Implement Dynamic Blocks for jobs in module                         |
| 4    | Add Workspaces (dev, stage, prod separation)                        |
| 5    | Use Locals to manage path/naming conventions                        |
| 6    | Add Lifecycle rules (prevent\_destroy for critical files)           |
| 7    | Configure Outputs (file names, paths)                               |
| 8    | Use Terraform CLI professionally (plan, apply, taint, output, etc.) |
| 9    | Test all environments and validate outputs                          |
| 10   | Final polishing and documentation for GitHub or Resume              |

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-link.git
   cd terraform-cicd-pipeline
   ```

2. **Install Terraform:**
   Make sure you have Terraform v1.x installed.

3. **Initialize Terraform:**

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Create or select a workspace:**

   ```bash
   terraform workspace new dev
   terraform workspace new stage
   terraform workspace new prod
   terraform workspace select dev
   ```

5. **Plan and Apply:**

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Generated Output:**
   You will find YAML files generated inside the project directory dynamically according to environment-specific variables.

7. **Optional: Remote Backend Setup:**
   If needed, configure Consul or any remote backend.
